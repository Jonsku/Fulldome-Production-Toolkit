Deploy on mac os x (linking Qt as Frameworks):
-Use Qt 4.74 Framework (4.7.3 is buggy)
-Compile FisheyAnimator with QtCreator:
-->Make sure the build phase is using the qmake of the framework
-->No DYLD_PATH needed
-->Compile release
NOTE: QJson is needed (download from git and build)
- Go to the folder now containing the CubeAnimator.app
- run sudo macdeployqt CubeAnimator.app
--> This will move the Qt framework in the bundle
-->  If running macdeployqt result in something like : ERROR: no file at "/opt/local/lib/libQtCore.4.dylib"
----> otool -L CubeAnimator.app/Contents/Frameworks/libqjson.0.dylib 
This gives something like:
@executable_path/../Frameworks/libqjson.0.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.7.1)
	@executable_path/../Frameworks/libQtCore.4.dylib (compatibility version 4.7.0, current version 4.7.2)
	/usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current version 7.9.0)
	/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 125.2.10)
----> tell libqjson to also use the framework:
sudo install_name_tool -change @executable_path/../Frameworks/libQtCore.4.dylib @executable_path/../Frameworks/QtCore.framework/Versions/4/QtCore CubeAnimator.app/Contents/Frameworks/libqjson.0.dylib 

----> Check again with otool if all the path are properly set
--> Run and enjoy!
